## Practice project on Chapter 1; Employee Records System

in this project you are required to design and build An Employee Records System, This time, you will end up with a fully functional C++ program that uses many of the features discussed in this chapter. This real-world example includes the use of classes, exceptions, streams, vectors, namespaces, references, and other language features. This program should be built against a database but it is out of the scope of this course so this part is removed. some concepts of software engineering are introduced for design and implement this project.

the steps of creating this project are ordered by readme, for example first section of this chapter is in #1- Requirements elicitation and Project design.md readme and the cpp file associated with it.
