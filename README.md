## Modern CPP Crash Course

The repository offers a discussion of Modern C++ based on the book `Professional C++` by Marc Gregoire. Each chapter is divided into three sections: discussion and examples, a practice project/lab, and solutions for selected exercises. Currently, Chapter 1 (`A Crash Course in C++ and the Standard Library`) is available. This chapter provides a concise overview of key concepts and fundamentals in C++ programming, along with working examples and solutions for selected exercises to support hands-on learning.

This repository is part of the Embedded Linux Course and will be expanded with summaries and exercises from additional chapters in the future.
